# The Orbital Event Ontology (OEO)
The OEO is conceived as an ontology of events in orbital space, as part of a modular ontology architecutre for the orbital debris, SSA and orbital space environment domain. As such OEO classes may be part of a single broader ontology, e.g., OSEO, or SSAO. This is TBD.

Conceptual Note: Events are ontologically(philosophcially) contrasted with things or objects, however, alternative characterizations and deeper analysis requires a sustainable opportunity to pursue.
