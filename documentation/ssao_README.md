# The Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO)

## Description
The SSAO is an ontology of the SSA domain. It minimally consists of class terms for the processes and infrastructure by which persons and organizations achieve situational awareness of the the orbital space environment.
These specificlly include:
- observation, detection, identification, re-identification, and tracking processes of satellites in orbit
- the physical systems and infrastructure, e.g., SSA networks (telescopes, etc.)
- the observations and measurements themselves

If expanded, the SSAO scope is the broader SSA domain. This includes class terms for the satellites themselves, other types of orbiting objects, etc. As such, an expanded version of the SSA will include terms from ODO.
This is TBD.
