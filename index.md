The [Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology](https://github.com/rrovetto/Orbital-Space-Ontology-Project) (or OSEDO) is a knowledge modeling effort by [Robert J. Rovetto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jTkGEiMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) (<em>Contact:</em> rrovetto[at]terpalum.umd.edu), to create a standard formally defined vocabulary and <em>knowledge model</em> for the astronautical domain. I want the resulting ontologies (and thus metadata) to be used by the community. But I also want to help build ontologies (aka knowledge graphs) for organizations & academia projects.

### History & Context
Orbitology has fascinated me since my teens. In 2011 I thought of applying ontology to help with the orbital debris problem (1), after a space conference pr
esentation in Colorado mentioned the need for more debris data-integration and sharing. My idea was to (a) facilitate data sharing/integration so that more actionable knowledge of the orbital space environment can be achieved, and to (b) ontologically represent orbital concepts and objects, while also exploring relevant philosophical questions. After a few years on a path away from my orginial love of space, I've wanted this idea to afford a return to it--by applying what I had studied so that I could continue my space education, and ideally finding a space career-path. This will be an example of how non-stem background and interdisciplinary studies can contribute to stem and enter the stem community.

* I want my ontologies to be used by others
* I want to help build ontologies for the space sector (orgs., agencies, academia or university projects, companies, etc.)
* I want to work in a team environment so that I can learn from professionals in the repsective disciplines (astrodynamics, astroinformatics, systems engineering, computer science, AI, ontology, etc.). 
* I want to learn any necessary skills and knowledge (e.g., coding, astrodynamics) through a studensthip, on-the-job, or employer-funded opportunity. 
But I need to find professors interested in this project (and departments/programs that'll accept my non-stem degree) so I can return to university for a PhD or other degree. 
<em> This is part of my hopeful vision for a future degree on an astronautics topic, and a career in space.</em>
* I need professionals who see my potential, and would like to help me realize my project or give me the opportunity to work on a related project with them.

Unfortunately, no opportunity has been forthcoming since project conception, despite appealing to many similar projects appearing since my publications. A stable environment with professionals to develop and implement my ideas sutainably is needed.

### About Ontology
<em>Related topics & Keywords</em>: metadata, artificial intelligence (AI), knowledge model, domain model, knowledge graph, semantic model, linked data, big data, open data, knowledge representation and reasoning, conceptual model.

Ontology is interdisciplinary, originating in philosophy, and typically yields a conceptual model or classificaiton.

_Computational ontologies_ provide human- and computer-readable terminologies/taxonomies with a formally-specified semantics. Terms in the ontology tag data elements in databases, and are encoded in a language that allows computers to draw inferences (automated reasoning) and answer user-generated questions (database queries). Ontologies therefore provide metadata, a common vocabulary, and express a knowledge model for software applications to draw from and reason over. Ontology class terms (and their formal definitions) provide <em>semantic annotation</em> for database terms, which provides meaning to data that users can access. Ontologies can be developed to varying degrees of abstraction and formality, from the highly generic to the domain-specific, from a set of terms in OWL to a full axiomatic theory of a terminology or taxonomy/classification. 

Ontology development & engineering is has application in AI, informatics, information & data science, linked data, big data, the semantic web, and database management. It is part of knowledge engineering, a branch of AI. Practical goals of ontologies include: knowledge representation & reasoning, semantic interoperability, data-exchange, information fusion, data-mining, chatbots, and search & retrieval, etc. The concepts, distinctions and methodologies from philosophical and formal ontology may be used in contemporary computation ontology. Formal ontology is a branch of analytical metaphysics that uses logics to represent an ontological model.
