Welcome to the description page for the [Orbital Space Domain Ontology & Terminology Project](https://github.com/rrovetto/Orbital-Space-Ontology-Project), a knowledge modeling effort by [Robert J. Rovetto](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jTkGEiMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) (rrovetto[at]terpalum.umd.edu). I want the resulting ontologies to be used by the community. I also want to help build ontologies for space organizations and academia projects.

### History & Context
Orbitology has fascinated me since my teens. In 2011 I thought of applying ontology to help with the orbital debris problem (1), after an orbital debris conference presentation in Boulder, Colorado mentioned the need for more debris data-integration and sharing. My idea was to (a) facilitate data sharing/integration so that more actionable knowledge of the orbital space environment can be achieved, and to (b) formally and ontologically represent orbital concepts and objects, while also exploring relevant philosophical questions. After years on path away from my orginial love of space, I was excited that this could be a way to return to it--by applying what I had studied so that I could continue my space education, and ideally finding a space career-path. 

* I want my ontologies to be used by others
* I want to help build ontologies for the space sector (orgs., agencies, academia or university projects, companies, etc.)
* I want to work in a team environment so that I can learn from professionals in the repsective disciplines (astrodynamics, astroinformatics, systems engineering, computer science, AI, ontology, etc.). 
* I want to learn any necessary skills and knowledge (e.g., coding, astrodynamics) through a studensthip, on-the-job, or employer-funded opportunity. 
But I need to find professors interested in this project (and departments/programs that'll accept my non-stem degree) so I can return to university for a PhD or other degree. 
<em> This is part of my hopeful vision for a future degree on an astronautics topic, and a career in space.</em>
* I need professionals who see my potential, and would like to help me realize my project or give me the opportunity to work on a related project with them.

Unfortunately, no opportunity has been forthcoming. I've been struggling to find opportunties for this project since conception. Red-tape and my non-stem degrees have been obstacles, despite the fact that many of cohort with identicially backgrounds/degrees were afforded opportunity. Ontology is interdisciplinary and many projects use ontologists from non-STEM background to work on STEM topic areas. Relevant technical skills can and often are learned on the job. Negative experiences of being plagarised and treated poorly (all documented) created a sense of urgency to pursue this project (a work of love). This drove me to write and publish and prematurely, all out-of-pocket and in my own time. A stable environment to develop and implement the ideas sutainably is needed.

### About Ontology
_Computational ontologies_ are computer-readable terminologies/taxonomies with a formally-specified semantics. The terminologies are encoded in a language that allows computers to draw inferences and answer user-generated queries. Ontologies offer a knowledge model and a shared vocabulary for software applications to draw from and reason over. Ontology class terms (and formal definitions) provide semantic annotation for database terms, which provides meaning to data that users can access. Ontologies can be developed to varying degrees of abstraction and formality, from the highly generic to the domain-specific, from a set of terms in OWL to a full axiomatic theory of a terminology or taxonomy/classification. 

Ontology development & engineering is related to aritifial intelligence (AI), informatics, information & data science, linked-data, big data, the semantic web, knowledge graphs, and database management. They are part of the branch of AI known as knowledge engineering. Aims of ontologies include: knowledge representation & reasoning, domain modeling, semantic interoperability, data-exchange, information fusion, data-mining, and data search & retrieval. Having philosophical origins, concepts, distinctions and methodologies from philosophical and formal ontology may or may not be used in contemporary computation ontology. Formal ontology is a branch of analytical metaphysics that uses formal logics to represent an ontological model.
