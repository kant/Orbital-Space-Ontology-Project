Welcome to the current landing page for the [Orbital Space Ontology Project](https://github.com/rrovetto/Orbital-Space-Ontology-Project). Contact [the author](http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3835-7817) at rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu. Ontologies available upon request.

#### Project Goals
The development of a computational ontology or ontology suite for astronautics, the orbital space environment and applications thereof. A specific goal is to develop accurate domain reference ontologies that can be used across federated space databases. A conceptual goal is the philosophical and formal ontological analysis of fundamental orbital and astrodynamic concepts. Work is based on the publications listed below.
### Scope 
The scope or domain-of-interest include: the orbital and near-Earth space environment and space situational awareness(SSA). This includes: basic orbital concepts, satellites and other space objects, spacecraft maneuvers and operation, astrodynymic modeling, and thus [orbital debris ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01014)(1)(Rovetto, ESI 2015) ([PPT here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Rovetto/publication/311707634_Orbital_Debris_Ontology/links/585609c408ae77ec3706a80f/Orbital-Debris-Ontology.pdf?origin=publication_detail), [space situational awareness (SSA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01924)(2)(Rovetto & Kelso, 2016). 

#### Status
* Ontoogies are under development, subject to revision. No claims to completeness are made. 
* Open to collaborative development - contact author to help develop the ontologies 
* Need funding or employment/studentship opportunity to work sustainably
#### Seeking
* Funding
* Partners/co-workers: subject-matter experts (astrodynamicists) ontology developers, informaticists, computer scientistis. 
* Contract work, distance work
* Grants & professors or companies to apply for grants
* Author seeks a university degree studentship (toward a BS or MS in a space discipline; and a PhD in ontology, philosophy, or an interdisciplinary PhD with space).

* **OSO / OSDO/ OSEDO - The Orbital Space Ontology / Orbital Space Domain Ontology / Orbital Space Environment Ontology**
 A potential single ontology file containing the above modules. The SSAO may be renamed this. A generic formal represenation for the orbital space aboat any central body or astronomical reference frame.  

**Database-specific Ontologies**
* **[(UCSSO) The Union of Concerned Scientists Satellite Database Ontology]**(https://purl.org/space-ontology/ucsso) (UCSSO) (6)
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/ucsso
  
These ontologies aiim to be used by and developed for NASA ontologies and data resources, e.g., NASA SWEET, IVOA ontologies, and elsewhere.

#### Project Goals (specific)
* one or more orbital and SSA _terminologies_ 
* a general-purpose orbital ontology (OO) to ontologically model any orbit from inputted instance data (data on particular satellites), and ontologies for classifying orbital debris and other orbital space objects. 
* formal, conceptual and philosophical analysis of fundamental astronautical, astrodynamic and orbital concepts
* _Data sharing_ and integration among orbital debris or space object catalogues
* Teaching Innovation by applying ontologies to _space visualizations/graphical-simulations_, and conceptual modeling.
* _Reducing complexity_ of programming by providing a thorough data model for software to draw upon
* Identifying applications in space agencies where it may be of benefit, e.g., interconnection with NASA SWEET ontologies
* ...

#### History: Author Bio-Contextual-Efforts
This project has been a desired PhD topic since 2011 when I thought of applying ontology to the orbital debris (OD) domain (1) might help improving the OD hazard by facilitating sharing and integration (verifying documents/references available upon request. Hat tip to David Vallado, AGI.). I've hoped to use it toward a foot-in-the-door to space eduation and entering the space sector (ideally NASA or ESA). However, since 2011 I've not been able to find a PhD or undergraduate position for this as a thesis. Additionally in that time, I pursued an ongoing search to do public service in maritime search and rescue. Finally and unfortunately, in the time since ideation of this project, persons and companies have seen the potential utility of it and took my ideas. I therefore urgently seek a funded opportunity to sustainably work on this project in a team environment with professionals in the required disciplines of astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontology engineering. I have developed many paper cocepts for co-authorship with interested parties, and have identified grants we may apply to. In pursuing this project I seek to find an opportunity to complete a STEM or interdisciplinary space degree (e.g., astronautics, astronautical engienering, astrodynamics, etc). 

#### Backgorund - Ontology
_Computational ontologies_ are computer-readable generic terminologies with a formal semantics. They provide data and knowledge models for software applications to draw from and reason over. Their class terms (and formal definitions) provide semantic annotation of database terms, which provides meaning to data. Ontology engineering is related to the fields of information/data science, linked-data, semantic web, artificial intelligence, and database management. Semantic interoperability, data-exchange, data-fusion, data-mining, data-extraction, and knowledge representation are practical aims of ontologies. Concepts and distinctions from philosophical and formal ontology are often used.
