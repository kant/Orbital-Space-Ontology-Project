| Project Detail | Description |
| -------------|:-------------|
| Goals | - To help resolve the orbital debris problem by developing computable taxonomies that faciliate the exchange of orbtial debris data, which seeks to provide more actionable situational awareness of the orbital space environment. <br>- The development of one ore more semantically-rich computational ontologies for the orbital debris problem, orbital objects (spacecraft, debris, etc.), space situational awareness (SSA), astronautics operations, space traffic management, and applications thereof. <br>- To develop accurate domain reference ontologies that can be used as a common knowledge model and shared vocabulary across federated space debris & SSA databases for: data sharing, data integration, data search & retrieval; semantic interoperabiltiy; classification & terminology development; domain modeling. <br>- To computationally and conceptually represent knowledge of SSA and astrodynamics. <br>- The philosophical & formal analysis (and clarification) of fundamental orbital and astrodynamic concepts. |
| Scope | <em>The scope of areas/domains to ontologically model include</em>: orbital debris, space situational awareness(SSA), space traffic management, the orbital & near-Earth space environment, astronautics. This includes: basic orbital concepts, satellites and other space objects, spacecraft maneuvers and operations, astrodynymic models, and thus [orbital debris ontology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01014)(1)(Rovetto, ESI 2015) ([PPT here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Rovetto/publication/311707634_Orbital_Debris_Ontology/links/585609c408ae77ec3706a80f/Orbital-Debris-Ontology.pdf?origin=publication_detail), [space situational awareness (SSA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01924)(2)(Rovetto & Kelso, 2016). |
| Status | Ontoogies are under development, subject to revision, but development is pending funding or employment to sustainably work on them. No claims to completeness are made. <br> Open to collaborative development. <br> Currently unfunded and independently pursued by the author, so funding & partners are needed to thoroughly develop the ontologies. |
| Seeking/Needing | -Funding or employment to pursue this project <br> - [DONATE HERE](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=6298778) <br> -Partners/Co-workers/Team: astrodynamicists (and other subject-matter experts), ontology developers, informaticists, computer scientistis, AI professionals, etc. <br> - Identifying applications in space agencies where these ontologies can be of benefit. <br> - Contract work or distance work. <br> - Professors (for studentship & grant proposals), Companies (to apply for grants/proposals). <br>-The author seeks to find a university degree studentship (toward a BS or MS in a space discipline; and a PhD in ontology, philosophy, or an interdisciplinary PhD with space).|

### History & Context
Orbital concepts have fascinated me since I was in my teens. I have been struggling to find opportunties for this project for years. Unnecessary obstacles and resistance to affording an opportunity have been the challenge. Since 2011 I've wanted this project to be an opportunity for further space education, and a foot-in-the-door to serve at NASA (or another space org.) toward a career path in the space sector. I want to help build ontologies at NASA and other agencies. I've wanted this since 2011 when I thought of applying ontology to help with the orbital debris problem(1), after David Vallado of Agi Inc. mentioned the need for more debris data-integration and sharing during a presentation at the ISDC conference in Boulder, CO. My idea was to (i) help the debris hazard by facilitating data sharing/integration so that greater actionable knowledge & awareness of the orbital debris environment can be achieved, as well as to (ii) formally and ontologically model orbital concepts. Through a studensthip or employer-funded opportunity, I wish to learn astrodynamics. This is part of my hopeful vision for a future degree on a space or astronautics topic, and a career in the space sector.

Unfortunately, no opportunity has been forthcoming. I've not been able to find a PhD spot or departments/professors interested in the topic. My non-stem degrees have been obstacles, despite the fact that others with similar backgrounds used connections to get positions, and despite the fact that by its very nature, ontology is interdisciplinary and many projects use ontologists from non-STEM background to work on STEM topic areas. I've also experienced some persons and companies take my ideas (proof of plagarism available upon request). A sense of urgeny to realize this project (a dream-work, a life aspiration) has therefore driven me to write and publish at my expense. However, a job, a studenthip or other funded opportunity is needed to work on the project.  

If you are interested in helping realize this project, please contact me. I wish to work ideally in a team environment so that I can learn from professionals in the repsective disciplines (astrodynamics, astroinformatics, systems engineering, computer science, knowledge engineering, etc.). I seek a studentship for STEM or interdisciplinary space degree (e.g., astronautics, astronautical engienering, astrodynamics, space studies, etc). Funding sources, professors, and professionals who have intereste in this project should contact me (rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu)

### About Ontology
_Computational ontologies_ are computer-readable terminologies/taxonomies with a formally-specified semantics. The terminologies are encoded in a language that allows computers to draw inferences and answer user-generated queries. Ontologies can provide knowledge models and a shared vocabulary for software applications to draw from and reason over. Ontology class terms (and formal definitions) provide semantic annotation for database terms, which provides meaning to data that users can access. Ontologies can be developed to varying degrees of abstraction and formality, from the highly generic to the domain-specific, from a set of terms in OWL to a full axiomatic theory of a terminology or taxonomy/classification. Ontology development & engineering is related to the fields of information/data-science, linked-data, big data, semantic web, artificial intelligence, and database management. Semantic interoperability, concept modeling, domain modeling, conceptual analysis, data-exchange, data-fusion, data-mining, data-extraction, and knowledge representation are practical aims of ontologies. Having origins in ancient philosophy, concepts, distinctions and methodologies from philosophical and formal ontology may or may not be used. Formal ontology is a branch of analyital metaphysics that uses formal logics to represent a ontological model.
