TBD: This folder contains pages for each term in the ontology suite, presumably one page per term including metadata about the given term. This includes specific information and the metadata annotations encoding or expressing that information: 

- IRIs

- intended meaning, captured via a metadata annotation, and in natural langauge to communcate most expressively in order to most clearly communicate the idea 
(should match with, if not be identical to, the definition)

- term label(s) , using metadata annotaitons such as rdfs:label, etc.

- term definition(s)
- Definition annotations, specified and specialized where needed, e.g., lexical definition, formal def, logical def. Using or mapping with existing metadata annotations such as rdfs:comment, skos:definition, dc:description, etc.

- creator or source of the: term, definition, etc.

- description of the ontology construct (class, relation, etc.) using annotation such as 'description of class'

- more general (broader0 term/category

- more specific (more narrow) term/category

- clarifying information

- ...other information...
