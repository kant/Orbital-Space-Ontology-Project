      <p>Welcome to the webpage for the <a href="https://github.com/rrovetto/Orbital-Space-Ontology-Project">Orbital Space Ontology Project</a>. The goal of this project is the development of a computational ontology or ontology suite for astronautical and space science applications. It is based on the publications listed below. </p>

<p><em>Computational ontologies</em> are computer-readible generic terminologies and taxonomies with a formal semantics. They are applicable to any data-intensive field, and provide data models and knowledge models for software applications and analytics to draw upon and reason over. Their class terms (and definitions) provide semantic annotation of data elements and terms in databases, thereby providing the meaning. Ontology engineering is related to fields of data science, linked-data, semantic web, artificial intelligence, information science and database management. Semantic interoperability, data-exchange, data-fusion, data-mining, data-extraction, and knowledge representation are practical aims of ontologies. Concepts and distinctions from philosophical and formal ontology are often used.</p>

<p>The scope or domain of the ontology project is that of the orbital and near-Earth space environment and space situational awareness (SSA). A specific sub-domain and focus is orbital debris[1], and related sciences, space operations, and modeling activities, such as astrodynamics. </p>

<p><strong>Selected specific goals include</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>an orbital and SSA <em>terminology</em> that can be used across ontologies and platforms</li>
<li>formal, conceptual and philosophical analysis of fundamental astronautical, astrodynamic and orbital concepts</li>
<li>a general-purpose orbital ontology to ontologically model any orbit from inputted instance data (data on particular satellites), and ontologies for classifying orbital debris and other orbital space objects. </li>
<li>
<em>Data sharing</em> and integration among orbital debris or space object catalogues</li>
<li>Teaching Innovation by applying ontologies to <em>space visualizations/graphical-simulations</em>, and conceptual modeling.</li>
<li>Reducing complexity of programming by providing a thorough data model for software to draw upon</li>
<li>Identifying applications in space agencies where it may be of benefit, e.g., interconnection with NASA SWEET ontologies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ontologies being developmented include</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>[The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)] [1]</li>
<li>[The Space Situational Awareness Ontology (SSAO)] [2]
The SSAO has been used by a NASA project for an ontology-driver orrery [].</li>
<li>Orbital Ontology</li>
<li>Orbital Object Ontology
Each ontology may form a sub-domain of the overall scope, collectively forming a <em>modular architecture</em> for reuse is distinct applications. For example, an ontology of orbital space environment requires modeling the object, events, their interrelations; and the observations, measurements, and astrodynamic modeling thereof.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived of the concept for applying ontology to the orbital debris <a href="OD">1</a> domain toward improving the OD hazard via ontology-based data sharing and integration (verifying documents and references available upon request). When not pursuing employment or maritime search and rescue, I've searched for (and continue to) a funded opportunity to sustainably work on this project in a team environment with professionals in the required disciplines astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontology engineering. I have developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a PhD project, and seek to also complete a space discipline degree, astronauitcs and orbital dynamics being my original passions. </p>
