# The Orbital Space Ontology Project
This project consists of developing one or more ontologies for the orbital space domain, construed to be orbital space environemnt and the scope of space situational awareness. 

## Ontologies (subject to revision, merger, etc.)
* **OO - The Orbital Ontology**
  A general purpose ontology for (i) representing orbits of any satellite, (ii) providing a common orbital terminology for other ontologies.
* **OSO (OSEO)- The Orbital Space Ontology (Orbital Space Environment/Domain Ontology)**
  The broadest scope encompassing and consisting of the following ontologies.
* **ODO - The Orbital Debris Ontology**
  An ontology for orbital debris objects
* **SSAO - The Space Situational Awareness Ontology**
  An ontology for SSA processes yielding knowledge of orbital space environment 
* **OEO - Orbital Event & Process Ontology**
  An ontology of occurrences in orbit, e.g. collisions
* **OOO - Orbital Object Ontology**
  An ontology of objects in orbital motion with orbital space of some central body or barycenter
* **NESEO - THe Near-Earth Space Environment Ontology**
  An ontology specifically for the near-Earth environment

## Status
Under development.
Subject to revision.
No claims to completeness.

**SEEKING sustainably funded opportunities to develop and complete the ontologies:**
* funded degree program (BS, MS in space subject; PhD in ontology, phi, interdisciplinary, or space studies); 
* Employment contract, 
* Grants (e.g., with NASA, ESA, EU, etc.)
* University professor to partner with to apply for grants
