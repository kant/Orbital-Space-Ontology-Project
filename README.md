# Orbital-Space-Ontology
An ontology of the orbital space domain (=orbital space environment domain), encompassing orbital debris and other orbital objects and phenomena. As such it includes classes from ODO (https://github.com/rrovetto/The-Orbital-Debris-Ontology/).

#Status#
Pending further development and research.

This ontology name better reflects and generalizes the overal orbital universe of discourse (subject-matter / domain of interest) of the Orbital Debris domain and the Orbital Debris Ontology  as expressed in [1][2].
