# The Orbital Space Ontology Project
This project consists of developing one or more ontologies for the orbital space domain, construed to be orbital space environemnt and the scope of space situational awareness. The following non-exhaustive list of ontologies are under development and conceived as part of a modular architecture, some or all of which may compse or be imported into a single large ontology called OSO (OSEO) (to be developed) to encompass the entire scope or domain of the ontology.

## Ontologies (subject to revision, merger, etc.)
* **OO - The Orbital Ontology**
  A general purpose ontology for (i) representing orbits of any satellite, (ii) providing a common orbital terminology for other ontologies.
* **OSO (OSEO)- The Orbital Space Ontology (Orbital Space Environment/Domain Ontology)**
  The broadest scope encompassing and consisting of the following ontologies.
* **ODO - The Orbital Debris Ontology**
  An ontology for orbital debris objects
* **SSAO - The Space Situational Awareness Ontology**
  An ontology for SSA processes yielding knowledge of orbital space environment 
* **OEO - Orbital Event & Process Ontology**
  An ontology of occurrences in orbit, e.g. collisions
* **OOO - Orbital Object Ontology**
  An ontology of objects in orbital motion with orbital space of some central body or barycenter
* **NESEO - THe Near-Earth Space Environment Ontology**
  An ontology specifically for the near-Earth environment
* **AMO - The Astrodynamics Modeling Ontology**
  An ontology of the astrodynamic models for objects in orbits. 
* **SWO - Space Weather Ontology**
  An ontology of space weather phenomena as contrasted with space artefacs such as artificial orbital debris. 
  SWO classes may be found in existing astronomy ontologies(TBD) 

## Status
Under development. Subject to revision. No claims to completeness. 

**SEEKING funded opportunities to sustainably develop and complete the ontologies:**
* Funded degree program (BS, MS in space subject; PhD in ontology, phi, interdisciplinary, or space studies); 
* Employment contract, 
* Grants (e.g., with NASA, ESA, EU, etc.)
* University professors or companies to partner with to apply for grants 
* Partners, coauthors, etc.

The scope of each ontology will overalp, which means there will be a set of ontology terms shared among the subdomain ontologies. This set of classes will tentatively be placed in an ontology file to be imported as a space term ontology core for the others.
