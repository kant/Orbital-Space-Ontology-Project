# The Orbital Space Environment Domain Reference Ontology Project

**This project needs support: sponsors, formal collaborations, technical experts, and work or study opportunities for the author**
* Please see the CONTRIBUTING page about the needs of the project.

## Sumamry
This project consists of developing a living domain reference ontology, and ontology suite, whose scope is astronautics (spaceflight) and the orbital space environemnt, including space situational awareness (SSA), here collectively called the 'orbital space domain'. It is neutral with respect to sector (civil, gov't, mil, etc.). The ontologies will provide formal representaitons of phenomena such as orbits, orbital knowledge, spacecraft, orbital debris, spacecraft maneuvers, orbital events, observational and other SSA data, space missions (and their space systems and ground systems), as well as space traffic management and space policy concepts. These, and related, entities will be grouped into modular ontologies the whole of which may be merged into a single space domain ontology file. Together this will form a unified knowledge model of the target domain, providing knowledge representation, metadata, vocabularies, and ontologies for astronautics.

The following ontologies are conceived as part of a modular architecture. They presently need: sponsors, contributors, technical services and support, or a work/study opportunity for the author to continue development. Some or all may compse a single ontology I call The Orbital Space Onology (OSO) or The Space Domain Ontology. There are various equivalent names that may be given to this ontology suite, such as: 'astronautical ontology suite', 'orbital space domain ontology' (OSDO), and 'orbital space environment domain ontology' (OSEDO). Each modular ontology can be used for a specific purpose, application or office, e.g. NASA's Orbital Debris Office may use ODO: The Orbital Debris Ontology. All content is subject to revision. If interested, contact the author.

## Ontologies to develop
(subject to revision, merger, etc.)

* **ODO - The Orbital Debris Ontology**
  An ontology representing orbital debris objects, and related things.
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/odo
* **SSAO - The Space Situational Awareness Ontology**
  An ontology for SSA processes, data, actors, and infrastructure, which yield actionable knowledge of orbital space environment.
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/ssao
* **OO - The Orbital Ontology Core (the "Orbitology Ontology")**
  A general-purpose ontology for (i) fundamental orbital concepts, (ii) representing the orbits of any satellite, (iii) providing a common orbital terminology for other ontologies. This is a base ontology consisting of generic but domain-specific classes for orbital entities for space domain ontologies. 
* **The Celestial Orbit Type Ontology (the Gravitaitonal/Astronomical Orbit Type Ontology)**
An ontology of orbit categories. An orbit type taxonomy with features unique to each.
* **OEO - Orbital Event & Process Ontology (the Orbital Activity Ontology)**
  An ontology of occurrences in orbit, e.g. collisions.
* **OOO - Orbital Object Ontology**
  An ontology of objects in orbital motion about some central body or barycenter. 
* **Space Mission Ontology**
  An ontology of generic Space mission design concepts.
* **NESEO - THe Near-Earth Space Environment Ontology**
  An ontology specifically for the near-Earth environment. This can be an ontological model of instance data, whereas OSO and the SSAO capture universal concepts. 
* **AMO - The Astrodynamics Modeling Ontology**
  An ontology of the astrodynamic models for objects in orbits. 
* **SWO - Space Weather Ontology**
  An ontology of space weather phenomena as contrasted with space artefacs such as artificial orbital debris. 
  SWO classes may be found in existing astronomy ontologies(TBD)  
* **OSO/OSDO/OSEDO - The Orbital Space Ontology / Orbital Space Domain Ontology / Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology**
  The broadest scope encompassing and consisting of the following ontologies. A generic formal represenation for the orbital space about any central body or 
  astronomical reference frame.  
* **UCSSO - The Union of Concerned Scientists Satellite Ontology**
  A case-study demonstration of building an ontology for a specific database. This is an ontology for UCS Satellite Database, not intended for any other (but intended to show that the SSAO or the OSO can be used for any database). 
  https://purl.org/space-ontology/ucsso
* **STMO - The Space Traffic Management Ontology (Space Traffic Coordination Ontology)**
  An ontology of STM concepts, to include organization, coordination and other activities for traffic in the orbital space environment. 

## Status & Desiderata
* Under development. All Subject to revision. No claims to completeness.
* _Need funding, sponsorship, employment option, and/or partners to complete work_ 
* Seeking professors interested in me as a PhD student for this project.
* Since 2011, this has been independently pursued by the author. So support, a team environment, mentorship, and work or study opportunity, is needed to sustainably develop and realize the project vision. Interested parties should make contact.

**SEEKING sponsors and other opportunities to sustainably continue development. The author is interested in:**
* A university degree studentship (a BS or MS in a space discipline; or a PhD in ontology, philosophy, or interdisciplinary) 
* Formal collaborations, e.g., contract work, regular employment, internships, etc.
* Grants (e.g., with NASA, ESA, EU, etc.)
* University professors and companies to partner with and apply for grants 
* Coauthors

### Example Users
* A planetary orbit visualization application with NASA colleagues.

## History, Author Bio-Contextual-Efforts
This has been a pursuit since 2011 when I thought of applying ontology to the orbital debris domain to help ameliorate the OD hazard via ontology-based data-sharing and integration (verifying documents and references available upon request). I continue to search for an opportunity to work sustainably on and complete this project, ideally in a team environment with professionals with the required knowledge, e.g., astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontological engineering. I have developed enough paper concepts to make this a PhD project, but also seek to enter a space discipline degree program, with astronauitcs and orbital dynamics being my original passions.
