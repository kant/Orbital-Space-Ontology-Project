  "body": "### Description\r\nThis project is toward the development of an ontology or ontology suite for the orbital space environment, specifically for the subdomains of orbital debris, space situational awareness, and related sciences and operations such as astrodynamics and astronautics. It aims at developing a generic orbital ontology to ontologically model any orbit from inputted instance data (data on particular satellites), and ontologies for classifying orbital debris and other orbital space objects.\r\n\r\nAlthough subject to revision, two architectures are conceived:\r\n1) If a single non-modular ontology--the OSO or OSEO--is to contain class and relationship terms for events in orbit, orbital object, space objects, causal factors, physical properties, satellites, predictive knowledge, orbits, trajectories, etc. In short, an ontology of the orbital space domain encompasses orbital debris and other orbital objects and phenomena. \r\n\r\n2) If composed of modular ontologies, the modular ontologies include [the Space Situational Awareness Ontology](http://rrovetto.github.io/space-situational-awareness-domain-ontology/)[2], [The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)](https://github.com/rrovetto/The-Orbital-Debris-Ontology/) and so forth as describe in publications and listed in the authors github repositories. \r\n\r\nThe name 'OSO' (Orbital Space Ontology) or 'OSEO' (Orbital Space Environment Domain Ontology) is conceived as an alternative and possibly more accurate name for an ontology of the domain of interest in question. It better captures the whole picture of objects, occurrences, processes, relationships in orbit (orbital space) and those activities and infrastructure by which we attain situational awareness of those objects, occurrences processes and relations in and of orbital space. This name may therefore replace that of the space situational awareness ontology, in whichcase SSAO would take on the more narrow scope described above (those entities yielding situational awareness of the orbital and near-earth space envrionment).\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nUnder development as circumstances permit, i.e. depending on funded sustainable opportunities to work on the project\r\n(Seeking funded opportunities: partners, contract employment, a BS or MS space degree fellowship, a phd degree position, grants, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Authors and References\r\nRobert J.
