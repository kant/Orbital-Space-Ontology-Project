  "body": "Welcome to the webpage for the Orbital Space Ontology Project. The goal of this project is the development of a computational ontology or ontology suite for astronautical and space science applications. It is based on the publications listed below. The scope or domain is that of the orbital and near-Earth space environment and space situational awareness (SSA). A specific subdomain and focus is that of orbital debris, and the related sciences, space operations, and modeling activities, such as astrodynamics. A specific goal is the development of a generic-purpose orbital ontology to ontologically model any orbit from inputted instance data (data on particular satellites), and ontologies for classifying orbital debris and other orbital space objects. \r\n\r\nLinks: \r\n* Click on the \"[View in Github](https://github.com/rrovetto/Orbital-Space-Ontology-Project)\" link to see the Github project development site\r\n* [Author github home](www.github.com/rrovetto)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n* Under development, subject to revision.

When not pursuing employment or maritime search and rescue, I've searched for (and continue to) a funded opportunity to sustainably work on, develop, and implement this ontology in a team environment with professionals in the requisite disciplines astrodynamics, astroinformatics, computer science, and ontology engineering. I have developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a PhD project, and seek to also complete a space discipline degree, astronauitcs and orbital dynamics being my original passions. \r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) Robert J.
