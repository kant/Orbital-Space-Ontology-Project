# Astronautics Vocabulary

## About
A living catalog of generic and key terms relevant for disciplines of spaceflight, orbital debris & space situational awareness (SSA), space domain awareness, and space traffic management (stm) has been in-progress.
It provides a listing of terms (with definitions from various sources) such as 'astronautics', 'spaceflight', 'orbital debris', 'ssa', 'stm', etc.

## Goals
- to provide said catalog as a general reference
- a semantic and conceptual analysis to help inform the development of ontologies for astronautics
- to identify inaccuracies and errors in existing terms and definitions
